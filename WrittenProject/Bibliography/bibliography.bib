The algorithm adopts a structural representation for Chinese characters, but in the classification and training process, the structural matching and parameter adjustment is conducted in a statistical way. Different from the conventional structural approaches, in this system, only a few predefined ``knowledge'' is required. In most cases, knowledge acquisition is simplified to ``memorization'' of examples, and the parameters for classification can be refined using statistical training. In this way it avoids the main difficulties inherent in the implementation of classification systems based on structural features. Compared with conventional statistical algorithms, the algorithm is based on a structural model of image patterns, so it has approximately all the advantages of structural pattern recognition algorithms. A prototype system has been realized based on this strategy, and the effectiveness of the method is verified by the experimental results.",

ABSTRACT = {This paper formulates an unsupervised algorithm for symbolization of signal time series to capture the embedded dynamic behavior. The key idea is to convert time series of the digital signal into a string of (spatially discrete) symbols from which the embedded dynamic information can be extracted in an unsupervised manner (i.e., no requirement for labeling of time series). The main challenges here are: (1) definition of the symbol assignment for the time series; (2) identification of the partitioning segment locations in the signal space of time series; and (3) construction of probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSA) from the symbol strings that contain temporal patterns. The reported work addresses these challenges by maximizing the mutual information measures between symbol strings and PFSA states. The proposed symbolization method has been validated by numerical simulation as well as by experimentation in a laboratory environment. Performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared to that of two commonly used algorithms of time series partitioning.},

ABSTRACT = {The complexity quantification of human gait time series has received considerable interest for wearable healthcare. Symbolic entropy is one of the most prevalent algorithms used to measure the complexity of a time series, but it fails to account for the multiple time scales and multi-channel statistical dependence inherent in such time series. To overcome this problem, multivariate multiscale symbolic entropy is proposed in this paper to distinguish the complexity of human gait signals in health and disease. The embedding dimension, time delay and quantization levels are appropriately designed to construct similarity of signals for calculating complexity of human gait. The proposed method can accurately detect healthy and pathologic group from realistic multivariate human gait time series on multiple scales. It strongly supports wearable healthcare with simplicity, robustness, and fast computation.},

abstract = {Symbol sequence generation is a crucial step in symbolic time series analysis of dynamical systems, which requires phase-space partitioning. This letter presents analytic signal space partitioning (ASSP) that relies on Hilbert transform of the observed real-valued data sequence into the corresponding complex-valued analytic signal. ASSP yields comparable performance as other partitioning methods, such as symbolic false nearest neighbor partitioning (SFNNP) and wavelet-space partitioning (WSP). The execution time of ASSP is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of SFNNP. Compared to WSP, the ASSP algorithm is analytically more rigorous and is approximately five times faster.},

The patterns of change contain valuable information about the dynamics of underlying control mechanism of the complex biological systems. Human gait is a complex process withmultiple inputs and numerous outputs. Various complexity analysis tools have been proposed to extract information from human gait time series. In this study, we used recently developed threshold based symbolic entropy to compare the spontaneous output of the human locomotors system during constrained and metronomically paced walking protocols. For that purpose, stride interval time series of healthy subjects who walked for 1 h at normal, slow and fast rates under different conditions was transformed into symbol sequences. Normalized corrected Shannon entropy (NCSE) was computed from the symbol sequences of the stride interval time series. The findings indicated that the unprompted output of human locomotors system is more complex during unconstrained normal walking as compared with slow, fast or metronomically paced walking.},

@article{Tirabassi2016,
abstract = {Many natural systems can be represented by complex networks of dynamical units with modular structure in the form of communities of densely interconnected nodes. Unraveling this community structure from observed data requires the development of appropriate tools, particularly when the nodes are embedded in a regular space grid and the datasets are short and noisy. Here we propose two methods to identify communities, and validate them with the analysis of climate datasets recorded at a regular grid of geographical locations covering the Earth surface. By identifying mutual lags among time-series recorded at different grid points, and by applying symbolic time-series analysis, we are able to extract meaningful regional communities, which can be interpreted in terms of large-scale climate phenomena. The methods proposed here are valuable tools for the study of other systems represented by networks of dynamical units, allowing the identification of communities, through time-series analysis of the observed output signals. Many real-world complex systems can be represented in terms of networks of interacting nodes embedded in space. Examples include power grids, fiber-optic networks, road networks, flight connections, etc 1–3 . Such net-works are usually organized in modules or communities of densely interconnected nodes 4–11 . The spatial embed-ding of the network can hidden the underlying community structure, rendering the identification of communities a challenging a task 12–14 . The effects of space in the topology of the network are particularly important when the network is built with correlation analysis of output signals which are recorded at a regular grid of observation points. Examples of this situation include brain functional networks 15–17 and climate networks 18–22 . Here we focus on climate networks, which provide relevant insight into global climate phenomena 23–31 . Previous work has shown that climate communities reveal coherent subsystems 32 , can be used for model inter-comparisons 33 , and can advance climate predictability 34 . For example, communities obtained from the analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) reveal information about long-term SST variability 35 . In our approach, a climate community is understood as a set of geographical regions that share some common property (dynamical or statistical) of the climate in those regions. Therefore, our approach differs from (and is complementary to) that aimed at performing a dimensionality reduction. For example, the work by Runge et al. 36},

@article{Rajagopalan,
abstract = {This paper presents symbolic time series analysis (STSA) of multi-dimensional measurement data for pattern identification in dynamical systems. The proposed methodology is built upon concepts derived from Information Theory and Automata Theory. The objective is not merely to classify the time series patterns but also to identify the variations therein. To achieve this goal, a symbol alphabet is constructed from raw data through partitioning of the data space. The maximum entropy method of partitioning is extended to multi-dimensional space. The resulting symbol sequences, generated from time series data, are used to model the dynamical information as finite state automata and the patterns are represented by the stationary state probability distributions. A novel procedure for determining the structure of the finite state automata, based on entropy rate, is introduced. The diversity among the observed patterns is quantified by a suitable measure. The efficacy of the STSA technique for pattern identification is demonstrated via laboratory experimentation on nonlinear systems.},

abstract="A major challenge in our networked world is the increasing amount of data, which require efficient and user-friendly solutions. A timely example is the biomedical domain: the trend towards personalized medicine has resulted in a sheer mass of the generated (-omics) data. In the life sciences domain, most data models are characterized by complexity, which makes manual analysis very time-consuming and frequently practically impossible. Computational methods may help; however, we must acknowledge that the problem-solving knowledge is located in the human mind and - not in machines. A strategic aim to find solutions for data intensive problems could lay in the combination of two areas, which bring ideal pre-conditions: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Knowledge Discovery (KDD). HCI deals with questions of human perception, cognition, intelligence, decision-making and interactive techniques of visualization, so it centers mainly on supervised methods. KDD deals mainly with questions of machine intelligence and data mining, in particular with the development of scalable algorithms for finding previously unknown relationships in data, thus centers on automatic computational methods. A proverb attributed perhaps incorrectly to Albert Einstein illustrates this perfectly: ``Computers are incredibly fast, accurate, but stupid. Humans are incredibly slow, inaccurate, but brilliant. Together they may be powerful beyond imagination''. Consequently, a novel approach is to combine HCI {\&} KDD in order to enhance human intelligence by computational intelligence.",

abstract = {Where did human language come from? How many languages are there? How do we acquire our first language or learn a second one? The highly acclaimed Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language by David Crystal answers these and other questions about language. From hieroglyphics to trucker talk, from Shakespeare in pidgin to sneezing in Tongan, this is a stimulating and richly illustrated guide to the variety, structure, history and theory of language. David Crystal not only conveys the intrinsic fascination of the subject, but also its enormous complexity. The visual dimension of the encyclopedia throws a fresh light on what has traditionally been treated as a non-visual subject, with many drawings, photographs, maps, display boxes and extracts all integrated within the text. In addition, appendices, meticulous cross-referencing and indexing ensure that this is an authoritative work of reference for students, professionals and general readers alike}}

The resource has 3 interdependent components. PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. PhysioNet is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software via the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet.org), PhysioNet offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels of expertise.},

abstract="Many high level representations of time series have been proposed for data mining, including Fourier transforms, wavelets, eigenwaves, piecewise polynomial models, etc. Many researchers have also considered symbolic representations of time series, noting that such representations would potentiality allow researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and bioinformatics communities. While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all suffer from two fatal flaws. First, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Second, although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on the original time series.",

abstract = { Objective: This article describes the origins and contributions of the naturalistic decision making (NDM) research approach. Background: NDM research emerged in the 1980s to study how people make decisions in real-world settings. Method: The findings and methods used by NDM researchers are presented along with their implications. Results: The NDM framework emphasizes the role of experience in enabling people to rapidly categorize situations to make effective decisions. Conclusion: The NDM focus on field settings and its interest in complex conditions provide insights for human factors practitioners about ways to improve performance. Application: The NDM approach has been used to improve performance through revisions of military doctrine, training that is focused on decision requirements, and the development of information technologies to support decision making and related cognitive functions. }

We propose a novel approach for QRS complex detection based on the deterministic finite automata with the addition of some constraints. This paper confirms that regular grammar is useful for extracting QRS complexes and interpreting normalized ECG signals. A QRS is assimilated to a pair of adjacent peaks which meet certain criteria of standard deviation and duration.",
