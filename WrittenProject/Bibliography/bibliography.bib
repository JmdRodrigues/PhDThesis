	abstract     = {An application of combined statistical and structural-syntactic approach in Chinese character recognition is presented. The algorithm adopts a structural representation for Chinese characters, but in the classification and training process, the structural matching and parameter adjustment is conducted in a statistical way. Different from the conventional structural approaches, in this system, only a few predefined ``knowledge'' is required. In most cases, knowledge acquisition is simplified to ``memorization'' of examples, and the parameters for classification can be refined using statistical training. In this way it avoids the main difficulties inherent in the implementation of classification systems based on structural features. Compared with conventional statistical algorithms, the algorithm is based on a structural model of image patterns, so it has approximately all the advantages of structural pattern recognition algorithms. A prototype system has been realized based on this strategy, and the effectiveness of the method is verified by the experimental results.}

	abstract     = {This paper formulates an unsupervised algorithm for symbolization of signal time series to capture the embedded dynamic behavior. The key idea is to convert time series of the digital signal into a string of (spatially discrete) symbols from which the embedded dynamic information can be extracted in an unsupervised manner (i.e., no requirement for labeling of time series). The main challenges here are: (1) definition of the symbol assignment for the time series; (2) identification of the partitioning segment locations in the signal space of time series; and (3) construction of probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSA) from the symbol strings that contain temporal patterns. The reported work addresses these challenges by maximizing the mutual information measures between symbol strings and PFSA states. The proposed symbolization method has been validated by numerical simulation as well as by experimentation in a laboratory environment. Performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared to that of two commonly used algorithms of time series partitioning.}

Symbolic entropy is one of the most prevalent algorithms used to measure the complexity of a time series, but it fails to account for the multiple time scales and multi-channel statistical dependence inherent in such time series. To overcome this problem, multivariate multiscale symbolic entropy is proposed in this paper to distinguish the complexity of human gait signals in health and disease. The embedding dimension, time delay and quantization levels are appropriately designed to construct similarity of signals for calculating complexity of human gait. The proposed method can accurately detect healthy and pathologic group from realistic multivariate human gait time series on multiple scales. It strongly supports wearable healthcare with simplicity, robustness, and fast computation.}

The execution time of ASSP is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of SFNNP. Compared to WSP, the ASSP algorithm is analytically more rigorous and is approximately five times faster.}

In this study, we used recently developed threshold based symbolic entropy to compare the spontaneous output of the human locomotors system during constrained and metronomically paced walking protocols. For that purpose, stride interval time series of healthy subjects who walked for 1 h at normal, slow and fast rates under different conditions was transformed into symbol sequences. Normalized corrected Shannon entropy (NCSE) was computed from the symbol sequences of the stride interval time series. The findings indicated that the unprompted output of human locomotors system is more complex during unconstrained normal walking as compared with slow, fast or metronomically paced walking.},

	abstract     = {Many natural systems can be represented by complex networks of dynamical units with modular structure in the form of communities of densely interconnected nodes. Unraveling this community structure from observed data requires the development of appropriate tools, particularly when the nodes are embedded in a regular space grid and the datasets are short and noisy. Here we propose two methods to identify communities, and validate them with the analysis of climate datasets recorded at a regular grid of geographical locations covering the Earth surface. By identifying mutual lags among time-series recorded at different grid points, and by applying symbolic time-series analysis, we are able to extract meaningful regional communities, which can be interpreted in terms of large-scale climate phenomena. The methods proposed here are valuable tools for the study of other systems represented by networks of dynamical units, allowing the identification of communities, through time-series analysis of the observed output signals. Many real-world complex systems can be represented in terms of networks of interacting nodes embedded in space. Examples include power grids, fiber-optic networks, road networks, flight connections, etc 1–3 . Such net-works are usually organized in modules or communities of densely interconnected nodes 4–11 . The spatial embed-ding of the network can hidden the underlying community structure, rendering the identification of communities a challenging a task 12–14 . The effects of space in the topology of the network are particularly important when the network is built with correlation analysis of output signals which are recorded at a regular grid of observation points. Examples of this situation include brain functional networks 15–17 and climate networks 18–22 . Here we focus on climate networks, which provide relevant insight into global climate phenomena 23–31 . Previous work has shown that climate communities reveal coherent subsystems 32 , can be used for model inter-comparisons 33 , and can advance climate predictability 34 . For example, communities obtained from the analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) reveal information about long-term SST variability 35 . In our approach, a climate community is understood as a set of geographical regions that share some common property (dynamical or statistical) of the climate in those regions. Therefore, our approach differs from (and is complementary to) that aimed at performing a dimensionality reduction. For example, the work by Runge et al. 36}

The proposed methodology is built upon concepts derived from Information Theory and Automata Theory. The objective is not merely to classify the time series patterns but also to identify the variations therein. To achieve this goal, a symbol alphabet is constructed from raw data through partitioning of the data space. The maximum entropy method of partitioning is extended to multi-dimensional space. The resulting symbol sequences, generated from time series data, are used to model the dynamical information as finite state automata and the patterns are represented by the stationary state probability distributions. A novel procedure for determining the structure of the finite state automata, based on entropy rate, is introduced. The diversity among the observed patterns is quantified by a suitable measure. The efficacy of the STSA technique for pattern identification is demonstrated via laboratory experimentation on nonlinear systems.}

	abstract     = {A major challenge in our networked world is the increasing amount of data, which require efficient and user-friendly solutions. A timely example is the biomedical domain: the trend towards personalized medicine has resulted in a sheer mass of the generated (-omics) data. In the life sciences domain, most data models are characterized by complexity, which makes manual analysis very time-consuming and frequently practically impossible. Computational methods may help; however, we must acknowledge that the problem-solving knowledge is located in the human mind and - not in machines. A strategic aim to find solutions for data intensive problems could lay in the combination of two areas, which bring ideal pre-conditions: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Knowledge Discovery (KDD). HCI deals with questions of human perception, cognition, intelligence, decision-making and interactive techniques of visualization, so it centers mainly on supervised methods. KDD deals mainly with questions of machine intelligence and data mining, in particular with the development of scalable algorithms for finding previously unknown relationships in data, thus centers on automatic computational methods. A proverb attributed perhaps incorrectly to Albert Einstein illustrates this perfectly: ``Computers are incredibly fast, accurate, but stupid. Humans are incredibly slow, inaccurate, but brilliant. Together they may be powerful beyond imagination''. Consequently, a novel approach is to combine HCI and KDD in order to enhance human intelligence by computational intelligence.}

	abstract     = {Where did human language come from? How many languages are there? How do we acquire our first language or learn a second one? The highly acclaimed Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language by David Crystal answers these and other questions about language. From hieroglyphics to trucker talk, from Shakespeare in pidgin to sneezing in Tongan, this is a stimulating and richly illustrated guide to the variety, structure, history and theory of language. David Crystal not only conveys the intrinsic fascination of the subject, but also its enormous complexity. The visual dimension of the encyclopedia throws a fresh light on what has traditionally been treated as a non-visual subject, with many drawings, photographs, maps, display boxes and extracts all integrated within the text. In addition, appendices, meticulous cross-referencing and indexing ensure that this is an authoritative work of reference for students, professionals and general readers alike}

The resource has 3 interdependent components. PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. PhysioNet is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software via the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet.org), PhysioNet offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels of expertise.},

While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all suffer from two fatal flaws. First, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Second, although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on the original time series.}

Background: NDM research emerged in the 1980s to study how people make decisions in real-world settings. Method: The findings and methods used by NDM researchers are presented along with their implications. Results: The NDM framework emphasizes the role of experience in enabling people to rapidly categorize situations to make effective decisions. Conclusion: The NDM focus on field settings and its interest in complex conditions provide insights for human factors practitioners about ways to improve performance. Application: The NDM approach has been used to improve performance through revisions of military doctrine, training that is focused on decision requirements, and the development of information technologies to support decision making and related cognitive functions.}

When these sensors are attached to the subject's body, they permit continuous monitoring of numerous physiological signals. This has appealing use in healthcare applications, e.g. the exploitation of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) in daily activity monitoring for elderly people. In this paper, we present a system for human physical Activity Recognition (AR) using smartphone inertial sensors. As these mobile phones are limited in terms of energy and computing power, we propose a novel hardware-friendly approach for multiclass classification. This method adapts the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) and exploits fixed-point arithmetic for computational cost reduction. A comparison with the traditional SVM shows a significant improvement in terms of computational costs while maintaining similar accuracy, which can contribute to develop more sustainable systems for AmI.}

One key organizational strategy that provides an improvement in the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders are job rotation schedules. These are usually designed manually, being (1) time demanding and (2) a subjective evaluation of the schedule's risk. In this work, a genetic algorithm is presented, to generate automatically a daily job rotation schedule. The quality of the schedule is based on objective scores as- signed to workstations by the European Assembly Worksheet (EAWS) risk screening tool, guiding the algorithm in reaching a final solution that promotes schedules with lower exposure to the sequence of workstations assigned to each worker of the team. The schedules generated by the algorithm were compared to schedules designed by the team leaders and presented a better overall result.}

In the analysis of time series data, how to represent data is a critical step for the performance. Generally, we can regard each time stamp as a feature dimension for time series data instance. However, this n{\"a}ive representation might be not suitable for data analysis due to the over-fitting of data. To address this problem, we proposed a temporal bag-of-words representation for time series classification. A codebook is generated by the representative subsequences from the time series data. Consequently, we encode a time series data instance by the codebook, which describes different local patterns of time series data. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve better results by comparing with competitive methods.}

However, noise has been paid surprisingly little attention to and is assumed to be filtered as part of a preprocessing step carried out by a human. Our Bag-of-SFA-Symbols (BOSS) model combines the extraction of substructures with the tolerance to extraneous and erroneous data using a noise reducing representation of the time series.

	abstract     = {Most data mining algorithms require the setting of many input parameters. Two main dangers of working with parameter-laden algorithms are the following. First, incorrect settings may cause an algorithm to fail in finding the true patterns. Second, a perhaps more insidious problem is that the algorithm may report spurious patterns that do not really exist, or greatly overestimate the significance of the reported patterns. This is especially likely when the user fails to understand the role of parameters in the data mining process.Data mining algorithms should have as few parameters as possible, ideally none. A parameter-free algorithm would limit our ability to impose our prejudices, expectations, and presumptions on the problem at hand, and would let the data itself speak to us. In this work, we show that recent results in bioinformatics and computational theory hold great promise for a parameter-free data-mining paradigm. The results are motivated by observations in Kolmogorov complexity theory. However, as a practical matter, they can be implemented using any off-the-shelf compression algorithm with the addition of just a dozen or so lines of code. We will show that this approach is competitive or superior to the state-of-the-art approaches in anomaly/interestingness detection, classification, and clustering with empirical tests on time series/DNA/text/video datasets.},

As a result, many time series representations and distance measures have been proposed. However, most existing work on time series similarity search relies on shape-based similarity matching. While some of the existing approaches work well for short time series data, they typically fail to produce satisfactory results when the sequence is long. For long sequences, it is more appropriate to consider the similarity based on the higher-level structures. In this work, we present a histogram-based representation for time series data, similar to the "bag of words" approach that is widely accepted by the text mining and information retrieval communities. We performed extensive experiments and show that our approach outperforms the leading existing methods in clustering, classification, and anomaly detection on dozens of real datasets. We further demonstrate that the representation allows rotation-invariant matching in shape datasets.},

	abstract     = {Time series (TS) occur in many scientific and commercial applications, ranging from earth surveillance to industry automation to the smart grids. An important type of TS analysis is classification, which can, for instance, improve energy load forecasting in smart grids by detecting the types of electronic devices based on their energy consumption profiles recorded by automatic sensors. Such sensor-driven applications are very often characterized by (a) very long TS and (b) very large TS datasets needing classification. However, current methods to time series classification (TSC) cannot cope with such data volumes at acceptable accuracy; they are either scalable but offer only inferior classification quality, or they achieve state-of-the-art classification quality but cannot scale to large data volumes. In this paper, we present WEASEL (Word ExtrAction for time SEries cLassification), a novel TSC method which is both fast and accurate. Like other state-of-the-art TSC methods, WEASEL transforms time series into feature vectors, using a sliding-window approach, which are then analyzed through a machine learning classifier. The novelty of WEASEL lies in its specific method for deriving features, resulting in a much smaller yet much more discriminative feature set. On the popular UCR benchmark of 85 TS datasets, WEASEL is more accurate than the best current non-ensemble algorithms at orders-of-magnitude lower classification and training times, and it is almost as accurate as ensemble classifiers, whose computational complexity makes them inapplicable even for mid-size datasets. The outstanding robustness of WEASEL is also confirmed by experiments on two real smart grid datasets, where it out-of-the-box achieves almost the same accuracy as highly tuned, domain-specific methods.},

	abstract     = {Time series data mining has received significant attention over the past decade, and many approaches have focused on classification tasks where the goal is to define the label of a test time series, given labeled training data. Time series classification approaches can be broadly grouped into two categories as instance-based and feature-based methods. Instance-based approaches utilize similarity information in a nearest-neighbor setting to classify time series data. Although approaches from this category provide accurate results, their performance degrades with long and noisy time series. On the other hand, feature-based approaches extract features to deal with the limitations of instance-based approaches; however, these approaches work with predefined features and may not be successful in certain classification problems. This study proposes a time series classification approach that benefits from both scale-space theory and bag-of-features technique. The method starts with finding the scale-space extrema points (i.e. key points) of each time series according to the SiZer (SIgnificant ZERo crossings of the derivatives) method, and then proceeds to create the local features set around these points. After extraction of the local features from each key point, a bag-of-features representation for each time series is constructed as the summary of the key point characteristics. We evaluate the success of the proposed representation on time series classification problems from various domains. Our experimental results show that our proposal provides competitive results compared to widely used approaches in the literature.}

However, the plethora of tools that target data exploration and pattern search may require an extensive amount of time to develop methods that correspond to the data scientist's reasoning, in order to solve their queries. The development of new methods, tightly related with the reasoning and visual analysis of time series data, is of great relevance to improving complexity and productivity of pattern and query search tasks. In this work, we propose a novel tool, capable of exploring time series data for pattern and query search tasks in a set of 3 symbolic steps: Pre-Processing, Symbolic Connotation and Search. The framework is called SSTS (Symbolic Search in Time Series) and uses regular expression queries to search the desired patterns in a symbolic representation of the signal. By adopting a set of symbolic methods, this approach has the purpose of increasing the expressiveness in solving standard pattern and query tasks, enabling the creation of queries more closely related to the reasoning and visual analysis of the signal. We demonstrate the tool's effectiveness by presenting 9 examples with several types of queries on time series. The SSTS queries were compared with standard code developed in Python, in terms of cognitive effort, vocabulary required, code length, volume, interpretation and difficulty metrics based on the Halstead complexity measures. The results demonstrate that this methodology is a valid approach and delivers a new abstraction layer on data analysis of time series.}

Current methods for identifying events require a sliding window of a fixed size, which is not ideal for all applications and could overlook important events. In this work, we develop probability models for calculating the significance of an arbitrary-sized sliding window and use these probabilities to find areas of significance. Because a brute force search of all sliding windows and all window sizes would be computationally intractable, we introduce a method for quickly approximating the results. We apply our method to over 100 000 astronomical time series from the MACHO survey, in which 56 different sections of the sky are considered, each with one or more known events. Our method was able to recover 100\% of these events in the top 1\% of the results, essentially pruning 99\% of the data. Interestingly, our method was able to identify events that do not pass traditional event discovery procedures. In this extended work, we present a generalization of our algorithm to discover different event types characterized by distinct patterns. Copyright © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

On these activities, we have obtained a recognition accuracy performance of 94.6{\%} using subject-dependent training and 56.3{\%} using subject-independent training. The addition of heart rate data improves subject-dependent recognition accuracy only by 1.2{\%} and subject-independent recognition only by 2.1{\%}. When recognizing activity type without differentiating intensity levels, we obtain a subject-independent performance of 80.6{\%}. We discuss why heart rate data has such little discriminatory power. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

Innumerable applications can be visualized, for instance, in medical, security, entertainment, and tactical scenarios. Despite human activity recognition (HAR) being an active field for more than a decade, there are still key aspects that, if addressed, would constitute a significant turn in the way people interact with mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art in HAR based on wearable sensors. A general architecture is first presented along with a description of the main components of any HAR system. We also propose a two-level taxonomy in accordance to the learning approach (either supervised or semi-supervised) and the response time (either offline or online). Then, the principal issues and challenges are discussed, as well as the main solutions to each one of them. Twenty eight systems are qualitatively evaluated in terms of recognition performance, energy consumption, obtrusiveness, and flexibility, among others. Finally, we present some open problems and ideas that, due to their high relevance, should be addressed in future research. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

We present a representation of joint motion suitable for the analysis of multidimensional angular joint motion time series data. Complex motion is reduced to a concatenation motion segments, where simple dynamic models approximate the observed motion on each segment. This compact representation still enables measurement of statistics familiar to ergonomics practitioners such as cycle length and task duration. An algorithm to obtain this representation from observed motion data (time series) is given. We introduce a metric, based on a kinetic energy-like measure, to compare motions. Experiments are presented to demonstrate the representation, its relationship to previous measures and the applicability of the kinetic energy metric for motion comparison.},

Since the human motion data may be captured with different modalities which have different temporal sampling rate and accuracy (e.g., Optical motion capture systems vs. Microsoft Kinect), we first apply a generic full-body kinematic model with an unscented Kalman filter to convert the motion data into a unified representation that is robust to noise. Furthermore, we extract the most representative kinematic parameters via the primary frequency analysis. The sequences are segmented based on zero-velocity crossing of the selected parameters followed by an adaptive k-means clustering to identify the repetition segments. Experimental results demonstrate that for the motion data captured by both the motion capture system and the Microsoft Kinect, our proposed algorithm obtains robust segmentation of repetitive action sequences.},

For periodic motion, the self-similarity measure is also periodic, and we apply time-frequency analysis to detect and characterize the periodic motion. A real-time system has been implemented to track and classify objects using periodicity. Examples of object classification, person counting, and non-stationary periodicity are provided.},

	abstract     = {The last decade has seen a flurry of research on all-pairs-similarity-search (or similarity joins) for text, DNA and a handful of other datatypes, and these systems have been applied to many diverse data mining problems. However, there has been surprisingly little progress made on similarity joins for time series subsequences. The lack of progress probably stems from the daunting nature of the problem. For even modest sized datasets the obvious nested-loop algorithm can take months, and the typical speed-up techniques in this domain (i.e., indexing, lower-bounding, triangular-inequality pruning and early abandoning) at best produce only one or two orders of magnitude speedup. In this work we introduce a novel scalable algorithm for time series subsequence all-pairs-similarity-search. For exceptionally large datasets, the algorithm can be trivially cast as an anytime algorithm and produce high-quality approximate solutions in reasonable time and/or be accelerated by a trivial porting to a GPU framework. The exact similarity join algorithm computes the answer to the time series motif and time series discord problem as a side-effect, and our algorithm incidentally provides the fastest known algorithm for both these extensively-studied problems. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas for many time series data mining problems, including motif discovery, novelty discovery, shapelet discovery, semantic segmentation, density estimation, and contrast set mining. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our ideas on domains as diverse as seismology, music processing, bioinformatics, human activity monitoring, electrical power-demand monitoring and medicine.},

Accurate and up-to-date information about the processes is a strict requirement to meet these needs. Real-time data capturing technologies, such as RFID, have already been used for some years in manufacturing environments, mainly for inventory management, planning and quality control. However, these systems fail to generate information on the performance of the operator in the system. This paper presents a video-based system that automates the analysis of manual assembly line work stations and generates near real-time information to support workers in their pursuit of continuous improvement. A work cycle classification method was developed to detect anomalous and problematic situations in the work flow. Besides the classification of work cycles, the method also generates performance indicators to analyze the performance of the operator in the system. These performance indicators are visualized in an operational dashboard, which reveals the improvement potential of the work station.},

	abstract     = {Time series anomaly detection remains one of the most active areas of research in data mining. In spite of the dozens of creative solutions proposed for this problem, recent empirical evidence suggests that time series discords, a relatively simple twenty-year old distance-based technique, remains among the state-of-art techniques. While there are many algorithms for computing the time series discords, they all have limitations. First, they are limited to the batch case, whereas the online case is more actionable. Second, these algorithms exhibit poor scalability beyond tens of thousands of datapoints. In this work we introduce DAMP, a novel algorithm that addresses both these issues. DAMP computes exact left-discords on fast arriving streams, at up to 300,000 Hz using a commodity desktop. This allows us to find time series discords in datasets with trillions of datapoints for the first time. We will demonstrate the utility of our algorithm with the most ambitious set of time series anomaly detection experiments ever conducted.},

	abstract     = {Falls remain an important problem in older people. There is strong evidence that falls can be prevented with appropriately designed intervention programs. To start a targeted fall prevention program, a first step is to identify those at high risk of falls. Sensor-based tests hold great promise for more frequent and accurate assessment of fall risk in clinical and home settings. The aims of this study were to a empirically examine the feasibility of the iStoppFalls Information and communications technology–based System to Predict &amp; Prevent Falls assessment, a Kinect and inertial sensor-based test for regular and unsupervised fall risk assessments at home, b investigate the experience of older adults with this home-based self-assessment, and c make recommendations for future assessments. The iStoppFalls assessment system was installed into the homes of 62 community-living older people in Australia, Germany, and Spain for the duration of 4&nbsp;months. Participants were asked to perform at least 1 assessment each month. The system use and the user experience were evaluated. To our knowledge, these are the first results on the long-term use of an unsupervised directed routine fall risk assessment system at private homes. In total, 241 assessments were independently performed by the participants. Most participants felt positive about their experience and could see themselves continuing with the assessment on a regular basis. Through the analysis the user motivation, the design and selection of appropriate tests, the user feedback, the reliability and usability of the applied technology, the frequency and duration of the assessment and the safety and support aspects were identified as important characteristics of a home-based self-assessment. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of a sensor-based self-assessment for fall risk but also highlight that further work is necessary. Future research should consider the necessary design requirements identified by this study.},
