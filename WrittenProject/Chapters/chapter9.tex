Future Work

- Associate the Bag of Words model weights with the shapes extracted. Save the subsequences and the words. Transform it in the bag of subsequences, and you can create a distance between the words. For instance, a Peak in Signal 1 might be different than a Peak in Signal 2. Or the signal might have the same dynamic (up down flat) but the up and down have a much different shape. By comparing the shapes, we might have an additional distance measure that makes the process more relevant...keep this in mind.
